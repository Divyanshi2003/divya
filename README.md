## Introduction

The Tooltip Button Generator is designed to allow users to create and customize tooltips for buttons using a form-based interface. Users can specify various properties for the tooltip, including target element, tooltip text, text size, padding, text color, background color, corner radius, tooltip width, arrow width, and arrow height.

When all the properties are selected by the user, the tooltip text will be displayed over the buttons when they are hovered upon. Additionally, the color of the arrow changes dynamically with the background color of the tooltip text.
